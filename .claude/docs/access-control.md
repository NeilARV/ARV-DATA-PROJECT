# Access Control — Canonical Reference

> **This is the single source of truth for authentication and authorization
> across the entire app.** When writing backend routes or frontend components
> that gate on auth state, always check this file first.
>
> The three core files that implement access control are:
> - `server/middleware/requireAuth.ts` — session check (401 if no session)
> - `server/middleware/requireRole.ts` — team role check (401 if no session, 403 if wrong role)
> - `server/middleware/requireSub.ts` — subscription tier check with optional role bypass (401 if no session, 403 if wrong tier and no bypass)
> - `client/src/hooks/use-auth.ts` — frontend auth state (roles, subscription flags, `canAccessApp`)

## 1. Middleware reference

### `requireAuth`
Checks `req.session.userId`. Returns `401` if no session. No role or subscription check.

```ts
// Usage
router.post("/", requireAuth, handler);
```

### `requireRole(roleOrRoles)`
Membership-based — **not hierarchical**. Every allowed role must be listed explicitly.
Checks `req.session.userId` first (returns `401` if missing), then queries `user_roles` for a matching role (returns `403` if none found).

```ts
// Usage — single role
router.patch("/:id", requireRole("admin"), handler);

// Usage — multiple roles (any one of these passes)
router.get("/", requireRole(["admin", "owner", "relationship-manager", "member"]), handler);
```

### `requireSub(tierOrTiers, options?)`
Checks `req.session.userId` first (returns `401` if missing).
If `bypassRoles` are provided, checks those roles first — a matching role skips the subscription check entirely.
If no bypass match, queries the user's subscription. Returns `403` if no matching tier.

`requireSub(["pro", "premium"])` — passes for **both** pro and premium subscribers; `premium` is not auto-inferred from `pro` (both tiers are listed explicitly).

```ts
// Usage
router.post("/", requireSub(["pro", "premium"], {
    bypassRoles: ["admin", "owner", "relationship-manager", "member"]
}), handler);
```

---

## 2. Role hierarchy

Roles are stored in `user_roles` and checked via `requireRole`. A user can have zero or more roles. "No role" means authenticated but unassigned.

```
owner                   ← highest
admin
relationship-manager    (RM)
member
(no role)               ← authenticated, no role assigned
(unauthenticated)       ← no session
```

> Roles are **membership-based**, not hierarchical. `requireRole(["admin"])` does NOT
> automatically pass for `owner`. Always list every allowed role explicitly.

Frontend flags from `useAuth()`:
- `isOwner`, `isAdmin`, `isRelationshipManager`, `isMember`
- `canAccessAdminPanel` — true if any team role (owner/admin/RM/member)
- `canAccessApp` — true if any subscription tier OR any team role

---

## 3. Subscription tiers

```
premium    ← highest
pro
basic
none       ← no active subscription
```

`requireSub(["pro", "premium"])` passes for pro and premium; fails for basic and none.
All four team roles (`admin`, `owner`, `relationship-manager`, `member`) bypass `requireSub` when listed in `bypassRoles`.

Frontend flags: `isPremium`, `isPro`, `isBasic`, `subscription` (raw tier string or null).

## 4. Status code contract

| Situation | Code |
|---|---|
| Not authenticated (no session) | 401 |
| Authenticated, wrong role or tier | 403 |
| Authenticated, ownership check failed in service | 403 |
| Validation failed | 400 |
| Resource not found | 404 |
| Success with data | 200 |
| Resource created | 201 |
| Success, no content | 204 |

---

## 5. Route permission tables

`requireRole` emits `401` for no session and `403` for wrong role.
`requireSub` emits `401` for no session and `403` for wrong tier (and no bypass role).
`requireAuth` emits `401` for no session only.

### 5.4 Deals (`/api/deals`)

`requireSub` emits `401` for no session, `403` for wrong tier with no bypass role.
Ownership is enforced in the service layer (not middleware), returning `403` if the caller is not the owner and doesn't have a qualifying role.

| Method | Route | Middleware chain | unauth | no-sub/no-role | pro or premium | member/RM | admin/owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/deals` | (public) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| GET | `/api/deals/:id` | (public) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| POST | `/api/deals` | `requireSub(["pro","premium"], bypass: all roles)` | 401 | 403 | ✓ | ✓ (bypass) | ✓ (bypass) |
| PATCH | `/api/deals/:id` | `requireSub(["pro","premium"], bypass: all roles)` + ownership in service | 401 | 403 | own only | own only (member) / any (RM) | any |
| DELETE | `/api/deals/:id` | `requireSub(["pro","premium"], bypass: all roles)` + ownership in service | 401 | 403 | own only | own only (member) / any (RM) | any |
| POST | `/api/deals/:id/request-info` | (public) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

**Ownership rules in service (confirmed):**
- `updateDeal`: owner of the deal, or `admin`/`owner` role. RM cannot edit another user's deal.
- `deleteDeal`: owner of the deal, or `admin`/`owner`/`relationship-manager` role. RM **can** delete any deal.

**Field-level stripping on POST/PATCH:**
The controller strips `isArvExclusive`, `onBehalfOfEmail`, and `adminNotes` if the caller is not admin/owner. These fields are silently ignored for non-privileged callers (no 403 — they get a 2xx but the fields are dropped).

### 5.5 Vendors (`/api/vendors`)

| Method | Route | Middleware chain | unauth | any authenticated | admin/owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/vendors` | (public) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| GET | `/api/vendors/recommended` | (public) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| GET | `/api/vendors/:vendorId` | (public) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| POST | `/api/vendors` | `requireRole(["admin","owner"])` | 401 | 403 | ✓ |
| PUT | `/api/vendors/:vendorId` | `requireRole(["admin","owner"])` | 401 | 403 | ✓ |
| PUT | `/api/vendors/:vendorId/recommend` | `requireRole(["admin","owner"])` | 401 | 403 | ✓ |
| DELETE | `/api/vendors/:vendorId` | `requireRole(["admin","owner"])` | 401 | 403 | ✓ |
| POST | `/api/vendors/:vendorId/logo` | `requireRole(["admin","owner"])` | 401 | 403 | ✓ |
| DELETE | `/api/vendors/:vendorId/logo` | `requireRole(["admin","owner"])` | 401 | 403 | ✓ |
| POST | `/api/vendors/:vendorId/header` | `requireRole(["admin","owner"])` | 401 | 403 | ✓ |
| DELETE | `/api/vendors/:vendorId/header` | `requireRole(["admin","owner"])` | 401 | 403 | ✓ |

RM, member, and no-role authenticated users all return `403` on vendor writes — no elevated permissions.

---

### 5.6 Posts (`/api/posts`)

Ownership enforced in service: author, admin, or owner can edit/delete. Other authenticated users get `403`.

| Method | Route | Middleware chain | unauth | authenticated (non-author) | author | admin/owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/posts` | (public) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| GET | `/api/posts/:postId` | (public) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| POST | `/api/posts` | `requireAuth` | 401 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| PUT | `/api/posts/:postId` | `requireAuth` + ownership in service | 401 | 403 | ✓ | ✓ |

### 5.11 Contact (`/api/contact`)

| Method | Route | Access | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/contact` | Public | Reads `req.session.userId` to route to user's RM if logged in, but auth is not required |

---

### 5.12 Mastermind — Channels (`/api/channels`)

Mastermind access = **any subscription tier OR any team role**. The read/list route is gated
by `requireMastermind` — a configured instance of `requireSub(['basic','pro','premium'], { bypassRoles: ['admin','owner','relationship-manager','member'] })` exported from
`server/middleware/requireMastermind.ts`. This is equivalent in meaning to the frontend
`canAccessApp` flag. The same file exports `isMastermindEligible(userId)` (the boolean form,
for the WebSocket upgrade handshake).

Channel **management** (create / rename / archive / delete) is admin/owner only and uses
`requireRole(['admin','owner'])` — stricter than `requireMastermind`, so it is not stacked.

Membership is **implicit**: every eligible user can read every public, non-archived channel
(no `channel_members` row required). `channel_members` rows are written lazily later to carry
read-state; they are not consulted for authorization in Phase 1.

| Method | Route | Middleware chain | unauth | no-role/no-sub | sub (basic/pro/prem) | member/RM | admin/owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/channels` | `requireMastermind` | 401 | 403 | ✓ | ✓ (bypass) | ✓ (bypass) |
| PATCH | `/api/channels/:id/read` | `requireMastermind` | 401 | 403 | ✓ | ✓ (bypass) | ✓ (bypass) |
| POST | `/api/channels` | `requireRole(['admin','owner'])` | 401 | 403 | 403 | 403 | ✓ |
| PATCH | `/api/channels/:id` | `requireRole(['admin','owner'])` | 401 | 403 | 403 | 403 | ✓ |
| POST | `/api/channels/:id/archive` | `requireRole(['admin','owner'])` | 401 | 403 | 403 | 403 | ✓ |
| DELETE | `/api/channels/:id` | `requireRole(['admin','owner'])` | 401 | 403 | 403 | 403 | ✓ |
| GET | `/api/channels/:id/members` | `requireMastermind` | 401 | 403 | ✓ | ✓ (bypass) | ✓ (bypass) |

**Behavior notes:**
- `GET /api/channels` returns public, non-archived channels (enriched with per-caller
  `unreadCount` / `hasMention`). Admin/owner may pass `?includeArchived=true` to include
  archived channels (the archive view); the flag is ignored for non-admin callers
  (controller-enforced), so they only ever see active channels.
- `PATCH /api/channels/:id/read` advances the caller's `channel_members.last_read_at` /
  `last_read_message_id` (the unread-badge clear). It upserts the caller's own
  `channel_members` row — this is the **lazy membership join point** — and returns `204`.
  It only ever touches the caller's own read-state, so no ownership check is needed beyond
  `requireMastermind`.
- `POST /api/channels/:id/archive` is a **soft** archive (`is_archived = true`).
- `DELETE /api/channels/:id` is a **hard** delete (cascade) and is only permitted when the
  channel is **already archived** — otherwise it returns `409` ("archive the channel before
  deleting"). This is the delete-twice safety net.

---

### 5.13 Mastermind — Messages (`/api/channels/:id/messages`, `/api/messages/:id`)

All message routes are gated by `requireMastermind` (same rule as channels: any subscription
tier OR any team role). There is **no** `requireRole` on these routes — author-vs-admin rules
are enforced **inside the service**, mirroring the Vendors posts pattern:

- **Edit (`PATCH /api/messages/:id`)** is **author-only** — a non-author is `403` *even for
  admin/owner*. This enforces the Mastermind design rule: admins may delete a message but may
  **never edit** what someone else said.
- **Delete (`DELETE /api/messages/:id`)** is allowed for the **author OR an admin/owner**.
  Delete is a **soft delete** (`is_deleted = true`, content blanked to a tombstone); messages
  are never hard-deleted.

| Method | Route | Middleware chain | unauth | no-role/no-sub | sub (basic/pro/prem) | member/RM | admin/owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/channels/:id/messages` | `requireMastermind` | 401 | 403 | ✓ | ✓ (bypass) | ✓ (bypass) |
| POST | `/api/channels/:id/messages` | `requireMastermind` | 401 | 403 | ✓ | ✓ (bypass) | ✓ (bypass) |
| PATCH | `/api/messages/:id` | `requireMastermind` (+ author-only in service) | 401 | 403 | ✓ own / 403 others | ✓ own / 403 others | ✓ own / **403 others** |
| DELETE | `/api/messages/:id` | `requireMastermind` (+ author-or-admin in service) | 401 | 403 | ✓ own / 403 others | ✓ own / 403 others | ✓ **any** |

**Behavior notes:**
- `GET …/messages` returns history newest-first via **keyset pagination** (`?cursor=<messageId>&limit=`,
  default 30, max 50) → `{ messages, nextCursor }`. Passing `?since=<messageId>` switches to
  **reconnect backfill** mode (messages newer than that id, oldest-first). Reads target public,
  non-archived channels only (archived/unknown → `404`).
- Soft-deleted messages are still returned, as **blank tombstones** (`isDeleted: true`, content
  stripped), so the timeline has no gaps.
- `POST …/messages` validates content with `createMessageSchema`, **sanitizes the TipTap HTML
  server-side** (stored-XSS protection), and rejects content that is empty once sanitized
  (`400`). Posting to an archived channel → `403`. `parentMessageId` is ignored in Phase 1.
- `PATCH /api/messages/:id` sets `is_edited = true`; editing a soft-deleted message → `409`.

**Real-time (`/ws`) upgrade gate:** the Mastermind WebSocket at `/ws` is **not** an Express
route, so the middleware table above doesn't apply. The upgrade is authenticated manually in
`server/websocket/auth.ts`: it reads the `connect.sid` session cookie, unsigns it with
`SESSION_SECRET`, loads the session, and requires `isMastermindEligible(userId)` — the **same
rule** as `requireMastermind`. A missing/invalid cookie, missing session, or ineligible user
causes the upgrade to be rejected with `401` (no socket opens). Once connected, a client may only
`subscribe` to public, non-archived channels.

---

### 5.14 Mastermind — Notifications (`/api/notifications`)

The in-app bell feed. All routes are gated by `requireMastermind` and are **self-scoped**: every
query/update filters on the caller's `user_id`, so a user can only ever read or mark their own
notifications — there is no admin view and no cross-user access at any role.

| Method | Route | Middleware chain | unauth | no-role/no-sub | sub (basic/pro/prem) | member/RM | admin/owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/notifications` | `requireMastermind` | 401 | 403 | ✓ | ✓ (bypass) | ✓ (bypass) |
| PATCH | `/api/notifications/:id/read` | `requireMastermind` (+ self-scoped in service) | 401 | 403 | ✓ own / 404 others | ✓ own / 404 others | ✓ own / **404 others** |
| PATCH | `/api/notifications/read-all` | `requireMastermind` | 401 | 403 | ✓ | ✓ (bypass) | ✓ (bypass) |

**Behavior notes:**
- Notification rows are created server-side only (mention fan-out on message create — `@user`
  rows get type `mention`, `@channel` expands to all eligible users as `channel_mention`,
  excluding the sender). There is no `POST /api/notifications`.
- `PATCH /api/notifications/:id/read` returns `404` (not `403`) when the row exists but belongs
  to another user, so the route does not leak which notification ids exist.
- New notifications are also pushed over the `/ws` socket (`notification.created`) to every
  connected tab of the recipient — same upgrade gate as §5.13.

## 6. How `testing.md` uses this file

When generating the mandatory access-control integration tests for a new or changed route:

1. Find the route's row above and read its **Middleware chain** and the allowed/blocked columns.
2. Generate, per `testing.md` baseline:
   - One test per **allowed** role/tier → expect `2xx`
   - One test for the **boundary blocked** role (next down from lowest allowed) → expect `403`
   - One **unauthenticated** test → expect `401`
   - For ownership routes, one **non-owner authenticated** test → expect `403`
3. For `requireSub` routes, also test the bypass: a bypass-role user with NO subscription → expect `2xx`.
4. See `tests/server/api/` for existing test patterns to follow. Tests for users, deals, and posts already exist and demonstrate the correct approach.

---

## 7. Maintenance rule

When a route is added, changed, or removed:
1. Update the matching table here **first**
2. Then write/update the code and tests against it

The per-app docs (`data.md`, `deals.md`, `vendors.md`) describe permissions at a high level for context. This file is the authoritative source and wins in any conflict.
