 * buyer is the current owning company. We deliberately do NOT trust `getPropertyTransactions`'
 * stored `sort_order`: user-appended transactions (`insertAtEnd`) leave sort_order out of recency
 * order, so trusting it would resolve a stale owner and alert the wrong company. A row with only a
 * `buyerName` (no `buyerId`) is an individual/unlinked owner: stored, never emailed.
 *
 * Notifiability resolves through the owner's operator group (#93), not `company_members`: an
 * ungrouped company, or a group with no members, is stored but not emailed (nobody to tell). When
 * notifiable, the resolution also carries the group's approval flag (`notificationsEnabled`) so the
 * consumer can gate the actual send.

 * @param propertyId the matched property
 * @returns the owning company id/name and whether at least one group member can be notified
